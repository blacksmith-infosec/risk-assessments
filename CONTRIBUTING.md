- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests and reload with file changes
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues reported in GitHub Issues
- **New features** - Add new security checks or scanners
- **Documentation** - Improve README, comments, or add examples
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Security improvements** - Enhance security features
- **UI/UX improvements** - Make the tool more user-friendly
- **Performance optimizations** - Make the tool faster or more efficient

### Before You Start

1. Check if there's an existing issue for what you want to work on
2. If not, create an issue describing your proposed changes
3. Wait for feedback before investing significant time
4. For major changes, discuss the approach first

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use React hooks appropriately

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/        # React context providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/           # Static data (questions, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/          # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-utils/     # Testing utilities
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `DomainScanner.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `domainValidation.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (e.g., `DomainScanResult`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW`)

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage (we use Vitest)
- Test files should be co-located with the code: `component.test.tsx`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:watch
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Ensure all checks pass**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint        # Code style
   npm test           # All tests
   npm run build      # Production build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add domain validation for scanner input (#123)"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link related issues
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

### PR Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR
- Address any requested changes
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
- Your contribution will be included in the next release!

## Reporting Bugs

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Verify you're using the latest version
- Test in a clean browser environment

### How to Submit a Good Bug Report

Include:

1. **Clear title** describing the issue
2. **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
3. **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
4. **Screenshots** if applicable
5. **Environment details**:
   - Browser and version
   - Operating system
   - Any relevant console errors

Example:

```markdown
**Bug**: Domain scanner fails on internationalized domain names

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to Domain Scan page
2. Enter domain: m√ºnchen.de
3. Click "Run Scanners"

**Expected**: Scanner should process the domain
**Actual**: Error message "Invalid domain format"

**Environment**: Chrome 119, macOS 14.1
```

## Suggesting Enhancements

We love new ideas! When suggesting enhancements:

1. **Check existing issues** for similar suggestions
2. **Provide clear use case** - explain the problem you're solving
3. **Describe the solution** - what should the feature do?
4. **Consider alternatives** - are there other approaches?
5. **Think about implementation** - is it feasible?

### Enhancement Template

```markdown
**Feature Request**: Add HTTPS enforcement check

**Problem**: Users can't easily check if their site enforces HTTPS

**Proposed Solution**:
Add a new scanner that checks:
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- HSTS header presence
- HSTS preload status

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Could be part of existing security headers check
- Could use external API vs custom implementation

**Additional Context**:
This would help users identify mixed content issues
```

## Security Considerations

### Security-First Development

Since this is a security assessment tool, please:

- **Validate all inputs** - especially user-provided domains and JSON
- **Sanitize outputs** - prevent XSS in displayed results
- **Consider privacy** - all data should stay local to the browser
- **Review dependencies** - check for known vulnerabilities
- **Follow secure coding practices** - avoid common pitfalls

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please see our [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.

## Questions?

- Open an issue for general questions
- Check existing issues and documentation first
- Be patient - this is a community-driven project
